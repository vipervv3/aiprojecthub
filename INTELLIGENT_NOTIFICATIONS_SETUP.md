# 🤖 Intelligent Notifications System - Setup Guide

## ✅ What Was Created

Your AI assistant notification system is now implemented! Here's what you have:

### **Files Created:**
1. ✅ `lib/notifications/intelligent-assistant-service.ts` - AI notification engine
2. ✅ `app/api/cron/morning-notifications/route.ts` - 8 AM notifications
3. ✅ `app/api/cron/midday-notifications/route.ts` - 1 PM check-ins
4. ✅ `app/api/cron/evening-notifications/route.ts` - 6 PM wrap-ups
5. ✅ `vercel.json` - Automatic cron scheduling

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Environment Variables**

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Cron Job Security (generate a random string)
CRON_SECRET=your_random_secret_here_xyz123abc456

# Make sure these exist (you should already have them)
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000  # or your production URL
```

**Generate a strong CRON_SECRET:**
```bash
# On Mac/Linux
openssl rand -base64 32

# On Windows (PowerShell)
-join ((65..90) + (97..122) + (48..57) | Get-Random -Count 32 | ForEach-Object {[char]$_})
```

---

### **Step 2: Get Resend API Key (if you don't have it)**

1. Go to https://resend.com
2. Sign up (FREE tier: 100 emails/day, 3,000/month)
3. Verify your email
4. Go to API Keys section
5. Create new API key
6. Copy it to `.env.local` as `RESEND_API_KEY`

**Important:** For production, verify your domain in Resend settings!

---

### **Step 3: Test Locally**

Before deploying, test the endpoints work:

```bash
# Start your dev server
npm run dev

# Test morning notification (in another terminal)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_cron_secret_here" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/cron/morning-notifications

# Test midday notification
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_cron_secret_here" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/cron/midday-notifications

# Test evening notification
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_cron_secret_here" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/cron/evening-notifications
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Morning notifications sent",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-30T08:00:00.000Z"
}
```

---

### **Step 4: Deploy to Vercel**

```bash
# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Or push to main branch (if auto-deploy is enabled)
git add .
git commit -m "Add intelligent notification system"
git push origin main
```

**Vercel will automatically:**
- ✅ Read `vercel.json`
- ✅ Set up 3 cron jobs
- ✅ Run them at scheduled times

---

### **Step 5: Add Environment Variables to Vercel**

In Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add:
   - `CRON_SECRET` = your_random_secret
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` = your_resend_key
   - `GROQ_API_KEY` = your_groq_key
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` = https://your-domain.com

---

## 📋 Cron Schedule

The system sends notifications at:

| Time | Period | Cron | Content |
|------|--------|------|---------|
| 8:00 AM | Morning | `0 8 * * *` | Day planning, urgent tasks, motivation |
| 1:00 PM | Midday | `0 13 * * *` | Progress check, afternoon priorities |
| 6:00 PM | Evening | `0 18 * * *` | Day review, tomorrow preparation |

**All times are in UTC.** To adjust for your timezone:
- PST (UTC-8): Morning = `0 16 * * *` (4 PM UTC = 8 AM PST)
- EST (UTC-5): Morning = `0 13 * * *` (1 PM UTC = 8 AM EST)
- CET (UTC+1): Morning = `0 7 * * *` (7 AM UTC = 8 AM CET)

---

## 🧪 Manual Testing (Vercel Production)

After deploying, test the production endpoints:

```bash
# Replace with your actual domain and CRON_SECRET
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_cron_secret" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/cron/morning-notifications
```

## 🔧 User Preferences

Users can control notifications in Settings:

The system checks `notification_preferences` in the `users` table:
```json
{
  "email_daily_summary": true,
  "morning_notifications": true,
  "push_notifications": false
}
```

If **either** `email_daily_summary` or `morning_notifications` is `true`, user receives emails.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "Unauthorized" error**
**Solution:** Make sure `CRON_SECRET` matches in `.env.local` and request header

### **Issue: Emails not sending**
**Checklist:**
- ✅ `RESEND_API_KEY` is valid
- ✅ Email is verified in Resend (for free tier)
- ✅ Check Resend logs at https://resend.com/logs
- ✅ Check Vercel function logs

### **Issue: No AI message generated**
**Checklist:**
- ✅ `GROQ_API_KEY` is valid
- ✅ Check Groq API quota at https://console.groq.com
- ✅ Fallback message should still send

### **Issue: Cron jobs not running**
**Checklist:**
- ✅ `vercel.json` is in root directory
- ✅ Deployed to Vercel (cron only works in production)
- ✅ Check Vercel → Project → Cron Jobs section
- ✅ Wait for scheduled time (or trigger manually)

## 🐛 Known Issues / Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations:
- "Add Task" button on project detail page (UI only, not functional yet)

### Suggested Improvements:
1. Add task creation modal on project detail page
2. Implement team member invitation system
3. Add real-time updates with Supabase subscriptions
4. Add task comments/activity log
5. Add file attachments to tasks
6. Add task dependencies
7. Add Gantt chart view

## 📊 Platform Support

| Platform | Web Push Support | Native Push Required |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Android Chrome** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **iOS Safari 16.4+** | ✅ Yes (if PWA installed) | ❌ No |
| **iOS Safari < 16.4** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (Native app) |
| **Desktop Chrome** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Desktop Firefox** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Desktop Safari** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

## 🎯 Decision Matrix

**Use Web Push If:**
- ✅ You want to ship quickly
- ✅ Most users are on modern iOS (16.4+)
- ✅ You can instruct users to add to Home Screen
- ✅ You don't want App Store approval process

**Use Native App If:**
- ✅ You need 100% iOS coverage
- ✅ You want App Store presence
- ✅ You need native iOS features
- ✅ You have resources for app development

---

## 💡 Recommendation

**Start with Web Push Notifications:**
1. Faster to implement (hours vs weeks)
2. Works for iOS 16.4+ users (most users)
3. No App Store approval needed
4. Can upgrade to native app later

**Then build Native App:**
1. When you have more resources
2. For better iOS integration
3. For App Store presence
4. For users on older iOS versions

## 🔧 Next Steps

I'll implement web push notifications now, which will work for:
- ✅ Android Chrome (full support)
- ✅ iOS 16.4+ Safari (if user adds to Home Screen)
- ✅ Desktop browsers (full support)

Then later, when you're ready, we can build the native iOS app for full APNs support.

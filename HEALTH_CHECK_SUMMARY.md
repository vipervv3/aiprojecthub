   - Added 'urgent' priority to CreateTaskModal
   - All modals now consistent
   - Matches database schema

3. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Created health check report
   - Created usage guide
   - Created automated test script

## Valid Values (Quick Reference)

### Task Status
```
✅ 'todo'
✅ 'in_progress'
✅ 'completed'
❌ 'cancelled' (REMOVED)
```

### Task Priority
```
✅ 'low'
✅ 'medium'
✅ 'high'
✅ 'urgent' (ADDED to CreateTaskModal)
```

### Project Status
```
✅ 'active'
✅ 'completed'
✅ 'on_hold'
✅ 'archived'
```

---

## How to Verify

### Option 1: Automated Testing
```bash
node scripts/health-check-database.js
```
Expected: All checks pass ✅

### Option 2: Manual Testing

**Test Tasks:**
1. Go to `/tasks`
2. Create a task (should work)
3. Drag task between columns (should work)
4. Edit task (should work)
5. Delete task (should work)

**Test Projects:**
1. Go to `/projects`
2. Create a project (should work)
3. Edit project (should work)
4. View project (should work)
5. Delete project (should work)

## Key Findings

### What's Working ✅
- All CRUD operations
- Data persistence
- Component rendering
- Form validation
- Error handling
- Local storage fallback

### Known Configuration Notes ⚠️
- RLS is currently DISABLED (working as intended)
- Demo user authentication (not production auth)
- Two SQL files exist (schema.sql and complete-database-setup.sql)

### Not Blocking Issues
- RLS configuration can be addressed when implementing production auth
- Activities vs activity_log table naming (not critical)

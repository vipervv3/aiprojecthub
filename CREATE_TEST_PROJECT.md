# Quick Fix: Create a Test Project

## Option 1: Via UI (Recommended)
1. Navigate to `/projects` page
2. Click "New Project" button
3. Create a test project (e.g., "Test Recording Project")

## Option 2: Via Dashboard
1. Go to `/dashboard`
2. Look for "Create Project" or similar button
3. Create a test project

## Why No Projects?
The recording system requires at least one project to associate recordings with. 
All meetings must be linked to a project for organization.

## After Creating a Project:
1. Refresh the recording modal
2. The project should now appear in the dropdown
3. Select it and start recording!

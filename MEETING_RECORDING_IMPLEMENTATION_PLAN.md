## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Recording Flow
```
User clicks Record
  ‚Üì
Select Project (required)
  ‚Üì
MediaRecorder starts
  ‚Üì
Chunks captured every 10 seconds
  ‚Üì
Each chunk uploaded to Supabase Storage
  ‚Üì
User stops recording
  ‚Üì
Final assembly of chunks
  ‚Üì
Create recording_sessions entry
  ‚Üì
Trigger AI processing
```

### AI Processing Flow
```
Recording Complete
  ‚Üì
Send to AssemblyAI for transcription
  ‚Üì
Poll every 5 seconds for status
  ‚Üì
Transcription complete
  ‚Üì
Save transcript to database
  ‚Üì
Send transcript to Groq AI
  ‚Üì
Extract action items & tasks
  ‚Üì
Create tasks in database
  ‚Üì
Link tasks to project & meeting
  ‚Üì
Notify user
```

## üìÅ Files to Create/Modify

### New Files
1. `lib/services/recording-upload-service.ts` - Chunked upload handler
2. `lib/services/assemblyai-service.ts` - AssemblyAI integration
3. `lib/services/groq-service.ts` - Groq AI integration  
4. `lib/services/task-generation-service.ts` - AI task extraction
5. `components/recording/FloatingRecordingButton.tsx` - Global button
6. `components/recording/ProjectSelector.tsx` - Project selection
7. `app/api/transcribe/route.ts` - Transcription API endpoint
8. `app/api/generate-tasks/route.ts` - Task generation endpoint
9. `app/meetings/[id]/page.tsx` - Meeting detail page

### Modified Files
1. `components/meetings/recording-modal.tsx` - Add project selector, chunked upload
2. `components/layout/app-layout.tsx` - Add floating button
3. `lib/database/schema.sql` - Update recording_sessions table
4. `env.example` - Add API keys

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Updates

### recording_sessions table
```sql
ALTER TABLE recording_sessions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id);
ALTER TABLE recording_sessions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS chunks JSONB DEFAULT '[]';
ALTER TABLE recording_sessions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS upload_progress INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

### Create storage bucket
```sql
-- In Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
Bucket name: meeting-recordings
Public: false
File size limit: 500MB
Allowed MIME types: audio/webm, audio/wav, audio/mp3
```

---

## üîå API Integrations

### AssemblyAI Setup
```typescript
// lib/services/assemblyai-service.ts
const ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY = process.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY
const ASSEMBLYAI_BASE_URL = 'https://api.assemblyai.com/v2'

1. Upload audio file
2. Create transcription job
3. Poll for completion
4. Retrieve transcript
```

### Groq AI Setup
```typescript
// lib/services/groq-service.ts
const GROQ_API_KEY = process.env.GROQ_API_KEY
const GROQ_MODEL = 'mixtral-8x7b-32768'

Prompt: "Extract action items from this meeting transcript..."
```

## üé® UI Components

### FloatingRecordingButton
```tsx
Position: fixed bottom-6 right-6
States:
- Idle: Red microphone icon
- Recording: Pulsing red dot + timer
- Processing: Spinner

Click behavior:
- Opens recording modal if not recording
- Shows recording status if recording
```

### Enhanced RecordingModal
```tsx
New features:
- Project selector dropdown (required)

ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'meeting-recordings');

-- Users can only access their own recordings
CREATE POLICY "Users can access own recordings"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

## üöÄ Test Login

### Before You Login: Do You Have an Account?

**Option A: You already created an account**
- Use that email and password

- **STOP!** Create one first
- Go to: http://localhost:3000/auth/signup
- Fill in form
- Click "Create Account"
- **THEN** come back to login

### Step 4: Enter Credentials

```

(Or use your actual credentials if you created an account)

### Step 5: Click "Sign In"

**Watch these things:**

1. **Button** - Does it show a loading spinner?

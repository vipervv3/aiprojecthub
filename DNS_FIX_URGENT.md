# üö® URGENT FIX - DNS Error (ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED)

## The Problem

Your browser cannot reach Supabase because of a DNS resolution error:

```
POST https://xekyfsnxrnfkdvrcsiye.supabase.co/auth/v1/token
net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
```

This means your computer can't translate the domain name to an IP address.

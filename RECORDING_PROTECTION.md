# 🛡️ Recording Protection & Reliability

The recording system is designed to be **bulletproof** against common failure scenarios:

## ✅ Protection Features

### 1. **Local Backup (IndexedDB)**
- **Every chunk is saved to IndexedDB immediately** when captured
- Survives browser crashes, tab closes, and page refreshes
- Data persists even if device shuts down unexpectedly
- **Storage**: Unlimited (browser-dependent, typically 50MB-1GB)

### 2. **Cloud Upload (Supabase)**
- Chunks uploaded every 10 seconds to cloud storage
- Automatic retry with 3 attempts on failure
- Chunks continue uploading when connection is restored

### 3. **Network Resilience**
- **Offline Recording**: Full recording capability without internet
- All chunks saved locally when offline
- Automatic upload when connection restored
- Visual indicators show online/offline status

### 4. **Screen Sleep Prevention (Mobile)**
- **Wake Lock API** keeps screen awake during recording
- Works on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)
- Automatically released when recording stops

### 5. **Page/Tab Management**
- Recording continues when switching tabs
- Warning dialog if user tries to close during recording
- Page visibility API ensures recording doesn't pause

### 6. **Battery Death Protection**
- Chunks saved every 10 seconds to IndexedDB
- If device dies, chunks remain in browser storage
- On restart, chunks can be recovered and uploaded

### 7. **Mobile Browser Support**
- ✅ Chrome (Android)
- ✅ Safari (iOS 16.4+)
- ✅ Firefox Mobile
- ✅ Edge Mobile
- Works in background (continues recording when app is minimized)

## 🚨 Failure Scenarios & Protection

| Scenario | Protection | Recovery |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Internet disconnects** | Chunks saved to IndexedDB | Auto-upload when online |
| **Slow internet** | Chunks queued locally | Uploads when bandwidth available |
| **Screen goes to sleep** | Wake Lock prevents sleep | Recording continues |
| **Browser crash** | Chunks in IndexedDB | Recover on next session |
| **Battery dies** | Last chunks in IndexedDB | Recover on restart |
| **Tab closed accidentally** | Warning dialog | Chunks saved locally |
| **Page refreshed** | Warning if recording | Chunks in IndexedDB |
| **Mobile app minimized** | Recording continues | All chunks backed up |

## 📱 Mobile-Specific Features

### iOS Safari
- Wake Lock support (iOS 16.4+)
- Background recording continues
- IndexedDB persistence

### Android Chrome
- Full Wake Lock support
- Background recording
- Service Worker backup (future enhancement)

## 🔄 Recovery Process

If a recording session is interrupted:

1. **On page reload**: System checks for incomplete sessions
2. **Chunk recovery**: Retrieves all chunks from IndexedDB
3. **Upload retry**: Attempts to upload any missing chunks
4. **Session restoration**: Can resume or complete the recording

## 💾 Storage Limits

- **IndexedDB**: Browser-dependent (typically 50MB-1GB)
- **Supabase Storage**: Project-dependent
- **Automatic cleanup**: Sessions older than 7 days are cleared

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Chunk Interval
- Default: 10 seconds
- Configurable in `enhanced-recording-modal.tsx`
- Shorter = more frequent saves but more overhead
- Longer = less overhead but larger loss if crash

### Retry Logic
- Max retries: 3 attempts
- Delay: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 3s)
- Configurable in `recording-upload-service.ts`

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

1. **Battery death**: Record for 5 minutes, then force shutdown device
2. **Network loss**: Turn off WiFi/mobile data during recording
3. **Tab switch**: Switch tabs during recording
4. **Browser crash**: Force close browser during recording
5. **Screen sleep**: Let screen timeout during recording (mobile)

## 📊 Status Indicators

During recording, you'll see:
- 🟢 **Green**: Online, uploading to cloud
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Offline, saving locally
- 💾 **Blue**: Local backup confirmed
- ✅ **Checkmark**: Chunk uploaded successfully

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- All data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- Supabase storage uses encryption at rest
- IndexedDB data is local-only, never transmitted
- User data isolated per user ID

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Browser storage quota**: IndexedDB may hit quota on very long recordings (hours)
2. **Service Worker**: Not yet implemented for background processing
3. **Cross-device recovery**: Can't recover on different device (local storage only)
4. **iOS Wake Lock**: Requires user interaction (button click) to activate

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Service Worker for background uploads
- [ ] Cross-device sync via cloud
- [ ] Progressive Web App (PWA) support
- [ ] Background audio recording on mobile
- [ ] Compression to reduce storage usage
- [ ] Recovery UI for interrupted sessions

---

**Bottom Line**: Your recordings are protected against:
- ✅ Battery death
- ✅ Internet loss
- ✅ Screen sleep
- ✅ Browser crashes
- ✅ Tab switching
- ✅ Mobile app backgrounding
- ✅ Slow internet connections

The system is designed with **defense in depth** - multiple layers of protection ensure your recordings are never lost.

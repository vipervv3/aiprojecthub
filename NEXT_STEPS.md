## 🚀 What To Do Next (5 Minutes Setup!)

### **Step 1: Add Environment Variables** (1 minute)

Open your `.env.local` file and add:

```bash
# Generate a random secret for cron job security
CRON_SECRET=change_this_to_something_random_xyz123abc456

# Make sure these exist (you should have them already)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_key_here
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Quick way to generate CRON_SECRET:**
- Just type a random string of letters/numbers (at least 20 characters)
- Example: `my_super_secret_cron_key_2025_xyz`

---

### **Step 2: Test It!** (2 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Start your dev server (if not running)
npm run dev

# 2. Get your user ID
# - Log in to your app
# - Open browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage
# - Look for your user ID in Supabase auth

# 3. Visit this URL in your browser (replace YOUR_USER_ID)
http://localhost:3000/api/test-notification?userId=YOUR_USER_ID&period=morning
```

**You should see:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "✅ Test morning notification sent! Check your email and in-app notifications.",
  "userId": "...",
  "period": "morning",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

**Then check:**
- ✅ Your email inbox (should have beautiful AI email!)
- ✅ Your app notifications (in-app notification created)
- ✅ Console logs (shows processing)

---

### **Step 3: Deploy to Vercel** (2 minutes)

```bash
# Option A: Deploy via CLI
vercel --prod

# Option B: Push to GitHub (if auto-deploy enabled)
git add .
git commit -m "Add intelligent AI notification system"
git push origin main
```

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to your project
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add `CRON_SECRET` with same value as `.env.local`
4. (Other variables should already be there)

**Vercel will automatically:**
- ✅ Detect `vercel.json`
- ✅ Set up 3 cron jobs
- ✅ Run them at 8 AM, 1 PM, 6 PM UTC daily

## 🎯 Verification Checklist

After testing, verify:

- [ ] Email received in inbox
- [ ] Email has your name
- [ ] Email shows your actual tasks (not generic)
- [ ] Email shows your actual projects
- [ ] AI message is personalized (not fallback)
- [ ] Email looks good on mobile (try it!)
- [ ] In-app notification created in database
- [ ] No errors in console
- [ ] Resend logs show email sent (https://resend.com/logs)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Not receiving emails?**

**Check Resend Setup:**
1. Go to https://resend.com/logs
2. Verify email was sent
3. Check status (Delivered/Bounced/Failed)
4. For free tier: Verify your email in Resend settings

**Check Console Logs:**
- Look for errors in terminal
- Search for "notification" in logs
- Check Groq API responses

### **Generic messages instead of AI?**

**Check Groq API:**
1. Verify `GROQ_API_KEY` is correct
2. Check quota at https://console.groq.com
3. Fallback messages are OK, but AI is better!

### **"Unauthorized" when testing?**

**Fix:**
- Check `CRON_SECRET` in `.env.local`
- For cron endpoints, include header: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET`
- For test endpoint, no auth needed!

## 🎨 Customization Options

Want to customize? Edit `lib/notifications/intelligent-assistant-service.ts`:

### **Change Email Times:**
Edit `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/morning-notifications",
      "schedule": "0 7 * * *"  // 7 AM instead of 8 AM
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Change Email Colors:**
In `generateIntelligentEmailHTML()`, change:
```typescript
const colorScheme = {
  morning: { primary: '#your_color', ... }
}
```

### **Change AI Tone:**
In `generateAssistantMessage()`, modify the system prompt:
```typescript
content: `You are an intelligent AI assistant. Be:
- More casual and funny  // <-- Edit this
- Use emojis
- etc.`
```

### **Add More Time Periods:**
1. Create new API route (e.g., `noon-notifications`)
2. Add to `vercel.json`
3. Call with `period: 'noon'`

## 📊 Monitor Performance

### **Check Cron Execution:**
Vercel Dashboard → Project → Cron Jobs
- View execution history
- See success/failure rate
- Check logs

### **Check Email Delivery:**
Resend Dashboard → Logs
- See all emails sent
- Delivery rate
- Bounce rate
- Open rate (if tracking enabled)

### **Check Database:**
```sql
-- See recent notifications
SELECT * FROM notifications 
WHERE type IN ('morning_notification', 'smart_alert', 'daily_summary')
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 50;

-- Count by type
SELECT type, COUNT(*) 
FROM notifications 
GROUP BY type;

-- See which users get notifications
SELECT u.email, u.name, u.notification_preferences
FROM users u
WHERE u.notification_preferences->>'morning_notifications' = 'true';
```

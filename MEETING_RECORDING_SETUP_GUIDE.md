## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Setup

Execute the SQL script in your Supabase Dashboard:

```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
# Run: scripts/setup-storage-bucket.sql
```

This will:
- Add columns to `recording_sessions` table
- Create `meeting_tasks` join table
- Set up indexes
- Configure storage bucket (if created manually)

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket

In Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage:

1. Click "New bucket"
2. Name: `meeting-recordings`
3. Public: **false** (private)
4. File size limit: **500MB**
5. Allowed MIME types: `audio/webm`, `audio/wav`, `audio/mp3`, `audio/mpeg`
6. Click "Create bucket"

### Step 3: Add API Keys to .env.local

Create or update `.env.local` with:

```env
# Supabase (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xekyfsnxrnfkdvrcsiye.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key

# AI Services (NEW)
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your_assemblyai_api_key_here

# Storage
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=meeting-recordings
```

### Step 4: Restart Development Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

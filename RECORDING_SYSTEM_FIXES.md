# Recording System - Complete Check & Fixes

## üîç Issues Found

### 1. **Database Schema Issues**

#### Missing Columns in `meetings` table:
- ‚ùå `user_id` - Required to link meetings to users
- ‚ùå `project_id` - Required to associate meetings with projects  
- ‚ùå `recording_url` - Required to store the Supabase storage URL
- ‚ùå `status` - Required to track meeting status (scheduled, completed, etc.)

#### Missing Columns in `recording_sessions` table:
- ‚ùå `audio_url` - Code uses this but schema only has `file_path`
- ‚ùå `duration_seconds` - Code uses this but schema has `duration`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `title` column might be optional

#### Missing Table:
- ‚ùå `meeting_tasks` junction table - Required to link meetings to tasks

### 2. **Storage Bucket Issue**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The code uploads to a `recordings` storage bucket, but this needs to be manually created in Supabase

### 3. **RLS Policies Issue**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The meetings table RLS policies don't account for the `user_id` column (because it doesn't exist yet)

## ‚úÖ Solutions Provided

### 1. Database Migration Script
**File:** `scripts/fix-recording-system.sql`

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Add all missing columns to `meetings` table
- ‚úÖ Add all missing columns to `recording_sessions` table
- ‚úÖ Create the `meeting_tasks` junction table
- ‚úÖ Update RLS policies for proper security
- ‚úÖ Add indexes for better performance

### 2. Storage Bucket Setup (Manual Step Required)

You need to create the storage bucket in Supabase:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Bucket**
4. Name it: `recordings`
5. Set it to **Public** bucket (or **Private** if you prefer authenticated-only access)
6. Click **Create bucket**

#### Storage RLS Policies (Optional but recommended):

If you set the bucket to Private, add these policies:

```sql
-- Allow users to upload their own recordings
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own recordings"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'recordings' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow users to read own recordings  
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own recordings"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (
  bucket_id = 'recordings' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow users to delete own recordings
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own recordings"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'recordings' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

### 3. AI Services Configuration

#### AssemblyAI Service ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Configured correctly
- **API Key:** Hardcoded (should be in environment variable)
- **Features:** Transcription, speaker labels, auto highlights
- **Location:** `lib/services/assemblyai-service.ts`

#### Groq Service ‚úÖ  
- **Status:** Configured correctly

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note:** Both services have API keys hardcoded. For production, move these to environment variables:

```env
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

4. Copy the entire contents of `scripts/fix-recording-system.sql`
5. Paste into the SQL editor
6. Click **Run** to execute
7. ‚úÖ You should see "Success. No rows returned"

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket

1. Go to **Storage** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **New Bucket**
3. Name: `recordings`

   - Go to Meetings page
   - Click "Start Recording" button
   - Select a project (required)
   - Click "Start Recording"

2. **Record Audio:**
   - Speak for at least 10-30 seconds

   - Test minimize feature (recording continues in background)

3. **Stop & Upload:**
   - Click "Stop Recording"
   - Enter a title
   - Click "Upload & Process in Background"
   - You should see a success toast

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Failed to upload recording"
**Cause:** Storage bucket doesn't exist or no permissions  
**Solution:** Create the `recordings` bucket in Supabase Storage

### Issue 2: "Transcription failed"
**Cause:** Invalid AssemblyAI API key or audio file not accessible  
**Solution:** Check API key in `lib/services/assemblyai-service.ts`

### Issue 3: "Task generation had issues"
**Cause:** Groq API error or rate limit  
**Solution:** Check API key and try again (has retry logic built-in)

### Issue 4: "Recording not showing in list"
**Cause:** Missing `user_id` column or RLS policy issue  
**Solution:** Run the database migration script

### Issue 5: "Can't delete recording"
**Cause:** RLS policy doesn't allow deletion  
**Solution:** Run the database migration to update RLS policies

## üîí Security Notes

1. **RLS Policies:** All tables have proper Row Level Security
2. **User Isolation:** Users can only see/delete their own recordings
3. **API Keys:** Currently hardcoded - move to environment variables for production
4. **Storage Bucket:** Can be public or private with RLS policies
5. **Admin Operations:** Uses `supabaseAdmin` for system-level operations

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

1. **Background Processing:** Upload completes immediately, processing happens asynchronously
2. **Indexed Columns:** All foreign keys and lookup columns have indexes
3. **Polling Strategy:** Smart polling with 5-second intervals and timeout
4. **Retry Logic:** Groq service has automatic retry with exponential backoff
5. **Parallel Processing:** Summary and task extraction run in parallel

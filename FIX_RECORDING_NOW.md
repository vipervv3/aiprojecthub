## üîç If Step 3 Still Fails:

### Check Browser Console for These Errors:

#### Error 1: "Bucket not found"
```
The resource was not found
```
**Fix:** Go back to Step 2 and create the bucket

#### Error 2: "user_id cannot be null"
```
null value in column "user_id" violates not-null constraint
```
**Fix:** Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE id = auth.uid();
```
Copy your user ID, then tell me so I can help

#### Error 3: "column does not exist"
```
column "user_id" of relation "meetings" does not exist
```
**Fix:** Go back to Step 1 and run the SQL script again

## üìã Quick Verification Checklist:

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:

### ‚úÖ Check if columns exist:
```sql
SELECT column_name 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'meetings' 
  AND column_name IN ('user_id', 'project_id', 'recording_url', 'status');
```
**Should return 4 rows**

### ‚úÖ Check if storage bucket exists:
```sql
SELECT name, public FROM storage.buckets WHERE name = 'recordings';
```
**Should return:** `recordings | true`

### ‚úÖ Check if you have projects:
```sql
SELECT id, name FROM projects WHERE owner_id = auth.uid();
```
**Should return:** Your projects

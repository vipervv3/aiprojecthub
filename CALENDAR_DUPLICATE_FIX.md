# 🔄 Calendar Duplicate Events - FIXED

## ✅ Issue Identified and Resolved

**Problem:** Calendar was showing duplicate events, especially from synced external calendars

**Root Causes Found:**
1. **Recurring events** from external calendars could create duplicate instances with similar UIDs
2. **Same event** appearing with different ID prefixes (e.g., `meeting-123` and `synced-123`)
3. **Multiple syncs** of the same calendar could import the same events twice

---

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Enhanced Deduplication Logic
**Before:**
```javascript
// Only checked if event.id was exactly the same
const uniqueEvents = calendarEvents.filter((event, index, self) =>
  index === self.findIndex((e) => e.id === event.id)
)
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Now checks multiple criteria:
// 1. Same ID (exact match)
// 2. Same title + same start time + same type (likely duplicate)
const uniqueEvents = calendarEvents.filter((event, index, self) => {
  return index === self.findIndex((e) => {
    // Check exact ID match
    if (e.id === event.id) return true
    
    // Check for functional duplicates
    const sameTitle = e.title === event.title
    const sameStartTime = e.start.getTime() === event.start.getTime()
    const sameType = e.type === event.type
    
    return sameTitle && sameStartTime && sameType
  })
})
```

### Fix #2: Pre-Deduplication for Synced Events
**Added:**
```javascript
// Track synced events by external_uid + start_time
const seenExternalUids = new Set<string>()

syncedEventsData.forEach((syncedEvent: any) => {
  const eventKey = `${syncedEvent.external_uid}-${syncedEvent.start_time}`
  
  if (!seenExternalUids.has(eventKey)) {
    seenExternalUids.add(eventKey)
    // Add event...
  } else {
    console.log(`🔄 Skipped duplicate synced event`)
  }
})
```

### Fix #3: Better Logging
```javascript
if (duplicateCount > 0) {
  console.warn(`⚠️ Removed ${duplicateCount} duplicate events`)
  console.log('📋 Duplicate details:', {
    total: calendarEvents.length,
    unique: uniqueEvents.length,
    removed: duplicateCount
  })
}
```

## 🎯 What This Fixes

### Scenario 1: Recurring Meeting Duplicates
**Before:**
```
Monday 10:00 AM - Team Standup
Monday 10:00 AM - Team Standup (duplicate)
Monday 10:00 AM - Team Standup (duplicate)
```

**After:**
```
Monday 10:00 AM - Team Standup ✅ (only once)
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Calendar Syncs
**Before:**
```
If you synced the same calendar twice:
- Meeting shows up twice
```

**After:**
```
Meeting shows up once ✅
(Duplicate automatically removed)
```

### Scenario 3: Same Event Different Sources
**Before:**
```
Created meeting manually: "Project Review"
Synced from Outlook: "Project Review" (same time)
Result: Shows twice
```

**After:**
```
Shows once ✅
(Detected as same title + time + type)
```

## 🧪 How to Verify the Fix

### Test 1: Check Browser Console
```
1. Open http://localhost:3000/calendar
2. Press F12 to open Developer Console
3. Refresh the page
4. Look for these logs:

✅ Good:
"📅 Total calendar events: 50 (50 unique)"
"✅ Added 30 unique enabled synced events to calendar"

⚠️ If duplicates were removed:
"⚠️ Removed 5 duplicate events"
"📋 Duplicate details: { total: 55, unique: 50, removed: 5 }"
```

### Test 2: Visual Check
```
1. Find a recurring meeting in your calendar
2. Check each day it repeats
3. ✅ Should appear only ONCE per day
4. ✅ Should NOT appear multiple times at the same time
```

### Test 3: Sync Same Calendar Twice
```
1. Sync your Outlook calendar
2. Wait for sync to complete
3. Sync the SAME calendar again (different name)
4. ✅ Events should NOT duplicate
5. ✅ Console should show "Skipped duplicate synced event"
```

---

## 📊 Deduplication Criteria

The system now removes duplicates using this logic:

```
Event A = Event B if ANY of these are true:

1. Same ID:
   event.id === "meeting-123"

2. Same Event Data:
   - Same title AND
   - Same start time (to the millisecond) AND
   - Same type (meeting/task/project/deadline)

3. Same External UID (for synced events):
   - Same external_uid AND
   - Same start_time
```

---

## 🔍 Debug Information

### Console Logs to Watch For:

**Good Logs:**
```
✅ "Loaded 30 synced events from external calendars"
✅ "Added 30 unique enabled synced events to calendar"
✅ "Total calendar events: 50 (50 unique)"
```

**Duplicate Detection:**
```
🔄 "Skipped duplicate synced event: Team Meeting at 2025-10-30T14:00:00Z"
⚠️ "Removed 3 duplicate events"
```

**Event Distribution:**
```
📊 Events by type: {
  meeting: 20,
  task: 15,
  project: 10,
  deadline: 5
}
```

---

## 🎯 Before vs After

### Before Fix:
```
Calendar shows 60 events
- 20 are duplicates
- User sees same meeting multiple times
- Confusing and cluttered
```

### After Fix:
```
Calendar shows 40 unique events ✅
- 20 duplicates removed automatically
- Each meeting appears exactly once
- Clean and accurate
```

---

## 📝 Additional Improvements

### Ordering
- Synced events now ordered by `start_time` (ascending)
- Makes deduplication more reliable
- Events display in chronological order

### Tracking
- Uses `Set<string>` for efficient duplicate detection
- O(1) lookup time (very fast)
- Handles thousands of events efficiently

### Logging
- Enhanced console logs for debugging
- Shows exactly which duplicates were skipped
- Helps identify sync issues

---

## 🚀 How to Test

### Quick Test (30 seconds):
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/calendar
2. Press F12 (open console)
3. Look for duplicate count in console
4. ✅ Should show "X unique" events
5. ✅ Visually check - no duplicate meetings at same time
```

### Full Test (5 minutes):
```
1. Pick a recurring meeting from your Outlook
2. Note when it repeats (e.g., "Every Monday at 10 AM")
3. Check each Monday in the calendar
4. ✅ Should appear exactly once per Monday
5. ✅ NOT 2-3 times on the same day
```

### Advanced Test (if you're technical):
```
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run: JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('calendar_events') || '[]')
3. Check for duplicate IDs or titles
4. ✅ Should see unique events only
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

After the fix:
- ✅ **No duplicate meetings** at the same time
- ✅ **Recurring events** appear once per occurrence
- ✅ **Multiple syncs** of same calendar don't duplicate
- ✅ **Console shows** duplicate removal count
- ✅ **Calendar is clean** and accurate

---

## 📱 What to Do If You Still See Duplicates

### If duplicates persist:

1. **Clear Calendar Cache:**
   ```
   - Press F12 (open console)
   - Run: localStorage.clear()
   - Refresh page
   ```

2. **Re-sync Calendars:**
   ```
   - Click "Sync Calendars"
   - Click refresh icon on each calendar
   - Wait for sync to complete
   ```

3. **Check Console Logs:**
   ```
   - Open F12 console
   - Look for red errors
   - Share the error messages
   ```

4. **Check for Multiple Syncs:**
   ```
   - Click "Sync Calendars"
   - Check "Connected Calendars" list
   - Delete duplicate calendar syncs
   ```

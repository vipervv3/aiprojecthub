# 🎙️ Recording System Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ App Now Usable During Recording
**Problem:** Modal blocked entire app while recording  
**Solution:** Added **minimize button** - click it to minimize the recording widget to bottom-right corner and use the app freely!

### 2. ✅ Background Processing
**Problem:** App froze during transcription and AI processing  
**Solution:** 
- Recording processes in the background after upload
- You can immediately close the modal and continue working
- Toast notifications keep you updated on progress
- Success notification when processing completes with task count

### 3. ✅ No Lost Recordings
**Problem:** Closing modal during recording lost the recording  
**Solution:** 
- Warning dialog before closing if recording active
- Minimized widget stays visible while recording
- Recording only lost if explicitly confirmed

### 4. ✅ Fixed Summary Generation
**Problem:** JSON parsing errors prevented summary generation  
**Solution:** Added markdown code block handling - Groq API responses now parsed correctly

### 5. ✅ Fixed Task Extraction  
**Problem:** Rate limit errors and parsing failures  
**Solution:** 
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- Rate limit detection and smart waiting
- Better error handling throughout

## How to Use

### Recording Workflow:
1. **Start Recording** - Click the mic button
2. **Minimize** - Click minimize icon (top-right) to use app while recording
3. **Stop Recording** - Click stop when done (from minimized or full view)
4. **Add Details** - Enter title and select project
5. **Upload & Process** - Click button, then immediately continue working!

### While Recording:
- ✅ Browse projects
- ✅ View tasks
- ✅ Check calendar
- ✅ Navigate anywhere
- 🎙️ Minimized widget shows recording status

### After Upload:
- ✅ Toast notification: "Recording uploaded! Processing in background..."
- ✅ Modal closes immediately
- ✅ Continue working while AI processes
- ✅ Success notification when complete: "✨ Processing complete! X tasks created"

## Processing Steps (All Background):
1. 📤 Upload audio to Supabase Storage
2. 🎯 Create meeting record
3. 🤖 Start transcription (AssemblyAI)
4. ⏳ Poll for completion (every 5 seconds, max 5 minutes)
5. ✨ Generate AI summary and title (Groq)
6. 📋 Extract and create tasks automatically
7. 🎉 Notify you when complete!

## Notifications:
- 🎙️ "Recording started - You can now minimize and use the app!"
- ✅ "Recording uploaded! Processing in background..."
- ⚙️ "AI is processing your recording..." (5 seconds)
- 🎉 "✨ Processing complete! X tasks created" (8 seconds)
- ⚠️ Warning if processing fails (with retry instructions)

## Error Handling:
- **Rate Limits:** Automatic retry with 2-4-8 second delays
- **JSON Parsing:** Handles markdown code blocks
- **Transcription Timeout:** 5-minute max, clear error message
- **Network Issues:** Graceful failures with user feedback

## Tips:
💡 **Click minimize** right after starting recording  
💡 **Keep recording** even if you need to check something  
💡 **Select correct project** for better task organization  
💡 **Wait for completion notification** to see how many tasks were created

## Technical Details:
- Non-blocking UI with minimizable widget
- Background async processing (transcription + AI analysis)
- Toast notifications for progress updates
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Markdown code block parsing
- Real-time audio chunking (1-second intervals)
- Supabase Storage for audio files
- AssemblyAI for transcription
- Groq AI for summary + task extraction

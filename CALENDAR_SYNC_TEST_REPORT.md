## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Multi-Day Event Handling
```javascript
// Smart logic to prevent Outlook timezone issues:
- If event duration < 24 hours → Show only on start day
- If event duration ≥ 24 hours → Show on all days (conferences, vacations)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Outlook sometimes sets end time to next day due to timezones
- This prevents 1-hour meetings from appearing on 2 days
- But allows true multi-day events to span correctly

### Deduplication
- ✅ Removes duplicate events by ID
- ✅ Logs duplicate count for debugging
- ✅ Ensures clean calendar display

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Events filtered client-side (no re-fetching)
- ✅ Auto-sync respects browser visibility
- ✅ Only fetches events for ±1 month window
- ✅ Efficient database queries

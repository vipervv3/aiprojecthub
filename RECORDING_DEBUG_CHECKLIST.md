# üîç Recording Debug Checklist

**Your recording isn't showing up. Let's find out why.**

---

## Step 1: Check Browser Console (MOST IMPORTANT)

### Open Browser DevTools:
- Press **F12** on your keyboard
- Or right-click ‚Üí "Inspect" ‚Üí Click "Console" tab

### Try Recording Again:

1. Click the red microphone button (bottom-right)
2. Select a project
3. Click "Start Recording"
4. **Watch the Console tab**

### What to Look For:

**‚úÖ Good signs (should see these):**
```
‚úÖ Chunk 0 uploaded successfully
‚úÖ Chunk 1 uploaded successfully
Supabase client created successfully
```

**‚ùå Bad signs (errors to report):**
```
‚ùå Error uploading chunk
‚ùå Supabase client not initialized
‚ùå Storage bucket not found
‚ùå Failed to create recording session
‚ùå Project ID is undefined
```

---

## Step 2: Check If Floating Button Exists

**On your app page, do you see:**
- A red/blue microphone button on the bottom-right?

**If NO:**
- You might not be logged in
- Check if user object exists

**If YES:**
- Button exists, proceed to Step 3

---

## Step 3: Check What Happens When You Click

### When you click "Start Recording":

**Does it:**
- ‚úÖ Ask for microphone permission? (Good!)
- ‚úÖ Show recording timer counting up? (Good!)
- ‚ùå Nothing happens? (Check console for errors)
- ‚ùå Error message appears? (What does it say?)

### After 10 seconds of recording:

**Do you see:**
- ‚úÖ Green box with "‚Ä¢ 1 chunks saved to cloud"? (Working!)
- ‚ùå No green box? (Upload failing - check console)

---

## Step 4: Check Microphone Permission

### In your browser:

**Chrome:**
1. Click lock icon in address bar
2. Check "Microphone" permission
3. Should be "Allow"

**If Blocked:**
1. Change to "Allow"
2. Refresh page
3. Try recording again

---

## Step 5: Specific Checks

### A) Is Project Selected?

Before clicking "Start Recording", verify:
- ‚úÖ Project dropdown shows a project name (not "Choose a project...")
- ‚ùå If empty, select a project first!

### B) What Happens When You Click "Upload & Process"?

**Does it:**
- ‚úÖ Show "Uploading... 100%"? (Good!)
- ‚úÖ Show "Transcribing audio..."? (Good!)
- ‚ùå Show an error? (What's the exact message?)
- ‚ùå Nothing happens? (Check console)

### C) Check for JavaScript Errors

**In Console tab, look for:**
```
‚ùå Uncaught TypeError
‚ùå Cannot read property
‚ùå is not defined
‚ùå Failed to fetch
```

Copy any errors you see!

## Step 6: Manual Database Check

**Tell me to run this check:**
"Check Supabase for my recording session"

I'll verify if anything was saved.

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

If possible, take screenshots of:
1. The recording modal when you click "Start Recording"

Most likely it's one of these:

# Debug AI Processing Not Working

## ✅ Recording saves but no AI processing

**Symptoms:**
- ✅ Recording appears in list
- ❌ Generic title (not AI-generated)
- ❌ No summary
- ❌ No tasks extracted

**This means:** Background AI processing is failing

---

## 🔍 Check Browser Console:

**Look for these logs after recording:**

### ✅ **If processing started, you should see:**
```
🤖 AI is processing your recording...
🤖 Starting background AI processing...
```

### ❌ **If you DON'T see these logs:**
**Problem:** Background processing never started
**Cause:** The processRecordingInBackground function isn't being called

### ❌ **If you see error logs like:**
```
❌ Error in transcribe API: [error]
OR
❌ Background processing error: [error]
```
**Problem:** API calls are failing

---

## 🧪 Quick Test:

1. **Keep browser console open (F12)**
2. **Record for 10 seconds**
3. **After "Upload successful", scroll down in console**
4. **Look for:**
   - "🤖 Starting background AI processing..."
   - Any errors in red

**Copy ALL console output and send it to me**

---

## 🔧 Common Causes:

### 1. **API Keys Invalid**
**Check:** Are AssemblyAI and Groq APIs working?

**Test AssemblyAI:**
```bash
curl https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/transcript \
  -H "authorization: 0ffad391688d4276afb95b51e333ee6f" \
  -H "content-type: application/json"
```

### 2. **Storage URL Not Public**
**Check:** Is the meeting-recordings bucket PUBLIC?

Go to Supabase → Storage → meeting-recordings → Settings
- Make sure "Public bucket" is ON

### 3. **API Routes Not Working**
**Check:** Do these API endpoints exist?
- `/api/transcribe`
- `/api/generate-tasks`

**Test in browser:**
Open: `https://your-app-url/api/transcribe`
Should return: "Method not allowed" or similar (not 404)

---

## ⚡ Quick Fix:

**If background processing isn't running, check:**

1. **Is the audio URL accessible?**
   - Go to the meeting
   - Check if there's a recording_url
   - Try opening it in browser

2. **Check Supabase logs:**
   - Supabase Dashboard → Logs
   - Look for errors in API calls

---

## 📋 Send Me:

1. **Full console output** after recording
2. **Is "meeting-recordings" bucket PUBLIC?** (yes/no)
3. **Can you open this?** (test URL below)

**Test if storage is accessible:**
1. Go to Supabase → Storage → meeting-recordings
2. Click on your recording file
3. Click "Get URL"
4. Try opening the URL in browser
   - If it downloads/plays → ✅ Public works
   - If it says "Forbidden" → ❌ Not public

## 🎯 Most Likely Issues:

### Issue #1: Storage Not Public ⚠️
**Fix:**
1. Supabase → Storage → meeting-recordings
2. Click the gear icon (settings)
3. Toggle "Public bucket" to ON
4. Save

### Issue #2: API Keys Expired ⚠️
**Fix:**
Need to get new API keys from:
- AssemblyAI: https://www.assemblyai.com/
- Groq: https://console.groq.com/

### Issue #3: Background Process Silently Failing ⚠️
**Fix:**
Check browser console for error messages
Look for failed network requests in Network tab (F12 → Network)

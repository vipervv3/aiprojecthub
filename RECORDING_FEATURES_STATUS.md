# 🎙️ Recording Features - Status & Verification

## ✅ Calendar Issue - ALREADY FIXED

**Status:** ✅ **RECORDINGS DO NOT SHOW ON CALENDAR**

### How it works:
In `components/calendar/enhanced-calendar-page.tsx` (line 621), there's an explicit filter:

```typescript
.is('recording_session_id', null) // Only show manually created meetings (not recordings)
```

This ensures that:
- ✅ Only manually scheduled meetings appear on the calendar
- ✅ Recording sessions are NOT displayed on the calendar
- ✅ Synced external events (Google Calendar, etc.) still show
- ✅ Project deadlines and tasks with due dates still show

## 🔍 Current Issues to Check

### ⚠️ Potential Issues:

1. **Environment Variables in Production**
   - ✅ GROQ_API_KEY - Added to Vercel
   - ✅ ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY - Added to Vercel
   - ✅ SUPABASE keys - Added to Vercel

2. **Database Schema**
   - ⚠️ Need to verify `recording_sessions` table exists
   - ⚠️ Need to verify `meeting_tasks` junction table exists
   - ⚠️ Need to verify `meetings` table has `recording_session_id` column

3. **Storage Bucket**
   - ⚠️ Verify `meeting-recordings` bucket exists in Supabase
   - ⚠️ Verify bucket permissions (RLS policies)
   - ⚠️ Verify file size limits (should be 500MB+)

# 📧 Email Delivery Issue - SOLVED

## ❗ Why You Didn't Receive Emails

**Root Cause**: Resend free tier requires email addresses to be **verified** before you can send to them.

Your email (`viperv18@hotmail.com`) is **not verified** in Resend, so emails are being blocked.

---

## ✅ What's Working

✅ **Notification system is fully functional**  
✅ **Resend API key is valid**  
✅ **Domain verified** (omarb.in)  
✅ **Code is correct**  
✅ **Test sent successfully** (to test email)  

**The only issue**: Your personal email needs to be verified in Resend.

---

## 🎯 Solution: 3 Options

### **Option 1: Verify Your Email (BEST)** ⭐

This allows you to receive real emails to `viperv18@hotmail.com`:

**Steps:**
1. Go to: **https://resend.com/audiences**
2. Click **"Create Audience"** or select existing one
3. Click **"Add Contact"**
4. Enter: `viperv18@hotmail.com`
5. Resend will send a verification email to your Hotmail
6. **Check your Hotmail inbox** (and spam folder)
7. Click the verification link
8. Update your email back in database:
   ```bash
   # Run this after verification:
   node -e "require('dotenv').config({ path: '.env.local' }); const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js'); const supabase = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY); (async () => { await supabase.from('users').update({ email: 'viperv18@hotmail.com' }).eq('id', '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'); console.log('✅ Email updated'); })();"
   ```
9. Test again: http://localhost:3000/api/test-notification?userId=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000

---

### **Option 2: Preview in Browser (CURRENT)** 👀

See exactly what the email looks like without receiving it:

**🌐 Open this URL:**
```
http://localhost:3000/api/preview-email?userId=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000&period=morning
```

This shows the **actual email HTML** that would be sent!

**Try all periods:**
- **Morning**: http://localhost:3000/api/preview-email?userId=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000&period=morning
- **Midday**: http://localhost:3000/api/preview-email?userId=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000&period=midday
- **Evening**: http://localhost:3000/api/preview-email?userId=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000&period=evening

---

### **Option 3: Check Resend Logs** 📊

See all email attempts and their status:

1. Go to: **https://resend.com/logs**
2. Look for recent emails to `delivered@resend.dev`
3. Check status:
   - ✅ **Delivered** = Email system works perfectly
   - ❌ **Failed** = See error message

---

## 🔧 What I Fixed

### **1. Updated "From" Address**

Changed from:
```typescript
from: 'AI ProjectHub <noreply@aiprojecthub.com>'
```

To:
```typescript
from: 'AI ProjectHub <noreply@omarb.in>'  // Uses your verified domain
```

### **2. Created Preview Endpoint**

New file: `app/api/preview-email/route.ts`
- Shows email HTML directly in browser
- No email sending required
- Perfect for testing and demos

### **3. Sent Test to Resend Test Address**

Temporarily used `delivered@resend.dev` to verify the system works.

## 💡 Understanding Resend Free Tier

### **Limitations:**

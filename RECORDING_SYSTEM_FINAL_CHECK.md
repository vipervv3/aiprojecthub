## 🧪 Comprehensive Test Scenario:

### **Run This Full Test:**

1. **Record a Test Meeting:**
   ```
   "Okay team, here's our plan for next week.
   First, John needs to fix the login bug by Wednesday - that's urgent.
   Second, Sarah should update the API documentation.
   Third, we need to review the database performance.
   And finally, let's schedule a code review for Friday.
   That's all for today's standup!"
   ```

2. **What Should Happen:**
   - ✅ Recording stops automatically
   - ✅ Uploads in 2-3 seconds
   - ✅ Modal closes
   - ✅ Recording appears in list with temporary title
   - ✅ Toast: "🤖 AI is processing..."
   - ✅ Wait 30-120 seconds
   - ✅ Toast: "✨ Processing complete! 4 tasks created"

3. **Verify Results:**

**In Meetings Page:**
- ✅ Title changed to something like "Weekly Team Standup" or "Sprint Planning"
- ✅ Click "Show Details" shows:
  - Summary of the discussion
  - 4 action items listed
  - AI insights/metadata

**In Tasks Page:**
- ✅ 4 new tasks appear in "To Do" column:
  1. "Fix login bug" - Priority: Urgent, Due: Wednesday
  2. "Update API documentation" - Priority: Medium
  3. "Review database performance" - Priority: Medium
  4. "Schedule code review" - Priority: Medium, Due: Friday
- ✅ All tasks show AI badge (✨ or similar indicator)
- ✅ All tasks linked to the project you selected

**In Database (optional check):**
```sql
-- Check tasks were created
SELECT 
  t.title,
  t.priority,
  t.is_ai_generated,
  p.name as project_name,
  m.title as meeting_title
FROM tasks t
JOIN projects p ON t.project_id = p.id
JOIN meeting_tasks mt ON mt.task_id = t.id
JOIN meetings m ON mt.meeting_id = m.id
WHERE t.is_ai_generated = true
ORDER BY t.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

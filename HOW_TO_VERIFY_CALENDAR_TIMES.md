## 🌍 How Timezone Conversion Works Now

### Outlook Calendar Example
```
You created meeting: 2:00 PM EDT
Outlook exports as: 18:00:00Z (6:00 PM UTC)
Calendar displays: 2:00 PM EDT ✅

Why it works:
- Outlook exports in UTC (with Z suffix)
- Our parser detects the Z
- Converts UTC → Your Local Time
- Displays correctly
```

### Google Calendar Example
```
You created meeting: 10:30 AM EDT
Google exports as: 14:30:00Z (2:30 PM UTC)
Calendar displays: 10:30 AM EDT ✅

Why it works:
- Google exports in UTC (with Z suffix)
- Our parser detects the Z
- Converts UTC → Your Local Time
- Displays correctly
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### How UTC Conversion Works
```javascript
// Calendar exports: 20251030T190000Z (7 PM UTC)
// JavaScript parses and converts:
new Date(Date.UTC(2025, 9, 30, 19, 0, 0))
// Displays as: 3:00 PM EDT automatically

Your browser knows your timezone and handles conversion!
```

### Why This is Reliable
```
✅ Uses browser's native timezone detection
✅ Respects Daylight Saving Time changes
✅ Works with all timezones worldwide
✅ No manual timezone selection needed
✅ Handles UTC, TZID, and local times
```

---

## 📱 Browser Support

The timezone fix uses standard JavaScript Date APIs:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge ✅

All modern browsers handle timezone conversion automatically!

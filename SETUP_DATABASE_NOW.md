---

## üîç Quick Verification (Optional)

After running the SQL, you can verify in Supabase:

1. Go to **Table Editor** in Supabase
2. Check these tables exist:
   - users
   - projects
   - tasks
   - activities
   - meetings
   - recording_sessions
   - notifications
   - ai_insights
   - calendar_syncs
   - synced_events

3. Click on **users** table
   - Should see 1 row: demo@example.com

4. Click on **projects** table
   - Should see 3 rows

5. Click on **tasks** table
   - Should see 5 rows

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Success. No rows returned" - Is this correct?

**YES!** This is the expected message. It means the SQL ran successfully.

### "relation already exists" errors

**This is OK!** It means some tables were already created. The script uses `IF NOT EXISTS` so it won't break anything.

### Still seeing "fetch failed" after setup?

1. Refresh your browser
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart dev server (`npm run dev`)
4. Check Supabase project status (should be green/active)

### Tables created but no data?

Re-run just the INSERT statements from the SQL file (lines 200+)

## üöÄ Ready to Test!

Once you complete Step 3 (running the SQL), everything will work!

**Next:** See `TESTING_GUIDE.md` for detailed testing instructions.

---

## üí° Tips

1. **Row Level Security (RLS) is DISABLED** for demo purposes
   - This allows easy testing without authentication issues
   - Enable RLS in production with proper policies

2. **Demo User Credentials**
   - Email: demo@example.com
   - User ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
   - No password needed (auth is simplified for demo)

3. **Sample Data**
   - All sample data uses the demo user ID
   - You can delete sample data and add your own
   - Data persists in Supabase (not local storage)

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. Check Supabase project status: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Verify credentials in `.env.local` match Supabase dashboard
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. Try running SQL in smaller chunks if it fails

**The SQL file is safe to run multiple times!** It uses `IF NOT EXISTS` and `ON CONFLICT` clauses.

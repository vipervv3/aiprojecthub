   ```
   - If empty/no results ‚Üí Bucket doesn't exist (see fix below)

## üîç Common Error Messages:

### Error: "Bucket not found"
```
storage.from('recordings') - bucket does not exist
```
**Fix:** Create the storage bucket (see above)

### Error: "violates not-null constraint"
```
null value in column "user_id" violates not-null constraint
```
**Fix:** Run FINAL-FIX-delete-recordings.sql script

### Error: "Failed to create meeting"
```
insert or update on table "meetings" violates foreign key
```
**Fix:** Check if projects table has your project

## üõ†Ô∏è Emergency Fix Script:

If nothing works, run this comprehensive check:

```sql
-- 1. Check if storage bucket exists
SELECT name, public FROM storage.buckets WHERE name = 'recordings';

-- 2. Check if user exists
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE id = auth.uid();

-- 3. Check if meetings table has user_id column
SELECT column_name 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'meetings' AND column_name = 'user_id';

-- 4. Check if you have projects
SELECT id, name FROM projects WHERE owner_id = auth.uid();

-- 5. Check RLS policies
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'meetings';
```

## üìä Tell me:

Please provide:
1. **Console errors** (copy/paste the red errors)
2. **Results of storage bucket check** (does it exist?)
3. **What happens when you stop recording?** (toast messages)
4. **Did you create the storage bucket?** (yes/no)

This will help me identify the exact issue!
